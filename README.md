# Hack-the-North-Tack

Tack is React App that uses the leaflet API to create pop-ups, and to connect students on campus. We call our app Tack, after the thumbtack
that is used to pin locations on maps!

#Installation and Usage

In order to utilize the base features of the app, clone the repo.

With the terminal, cd into Hack-the-North-Tack/client and type
`npm install`
this will install all node dependancies which are used in our project, then to run it,
`npm start`

Then go to `http://localhost:3000/frontpage` and enjoy!

The full npx express, and scripts to initalize the MySQl data base will come soon!
